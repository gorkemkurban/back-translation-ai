Linguaiser
About the Project
Linguaiser is an AI-powered back translation application designed to help users improve their language learning and translation skills through a multi-step back translation process. Using the Google Gemini AI model, the app generates original texts, allows users to translate and back-translate them, then provides detailed feedback by comparing the original and back-translated texts.
